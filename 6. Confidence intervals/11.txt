Other Types Of Confidence Intervals I
The last confidence interval you calculated was the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people who said they had road rage. Now let's try finding the 99% confidence interval (corresponding to a Z score of 2.58), and comparing what happens when we use these different intervals.

In your console, copy the steps from your script, and use this to calculate the range of the 95% confidence interval
In your console, copy and adapt the code from your script for finding the 99% confidence interval, and use this to calculate the range of the 99% confidence interval
In your script, report the ranges of each interval
In your script, report which confidence interval is wider as a single number (95 or 99)




# Make p the proportion of the sample with road rage 
p <- 75 / 200
# Find the standard error of p
se <- sqrt( (p * (1 - p)) / 200)
# Calculate the upper level of the 95% confidence interval
p + 1.96 * se
# Calculate the lower level of the 95% confidence interval
p - 1.96 * se
# Report the range of the 95% confidence interval
0.134192
# Report the range of the 99% confidence interval
0.1766405
# Which has the widest range?
99
