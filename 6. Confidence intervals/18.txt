Sample Size IV
Now you're conducting a study on what proportion of students drink alcohol and want to know what sample size to use for a confidence interval of 95%, with a margin of error of 0.05.

The sample size will be p multiplied by 1-p multiplied by the Z-score squared, divided by the margin of error squared. Let's try to find this using the 'safe approach' for p. This is the value above which the output p*(1-p) cannot get any larger (you can always go back to the lecture notes or click 'hint' if you don't remember what this is).

In your script, calculate the separate components of the sample size equation and assign to stated object
In your script, use the separate components to calculate sample size
Remember to format your calculations correctly and use () where appropriate




# Assign the value of p(1-p) and to object "p"
p <- 0.5 * ( 1 - 0.5 )
# Assign the value of the Z-score to new object "z"
z <- 1.96
# Assign the value of the margin of error squared to the new object "ms"
ms <- 0.05 ^ 2
# Calculate the neccessary sample size
p * z ^ 2 / ms
