Confidence Interval With Known SD II
In the last question we demonstrated how 95% of a population fall between 1.96 standard deviations above and below the population mean.
Let's pretend we have psychic knowledge that the standard deviation of sadness in the world is 8, but we need to find out what the mean is. We take a sample of 300 people. Let's estimate where the population mean is likely to lie using this sample.

If you remember, the formula for calculating the confidence interval is the sample mean +/- 1.96 * standard deviation. In this case, the standard deviation is the population standard deviation, divided by the square root of the sample size.

Instructions
100 XP
The saddness level of each participant in your sample is saved in your console as samp
Complete the steps in your script to calculate the confidence interval for samp
Remember to format your calculations correctly and use () where appropriate



# Assign the sample mean to object "m"
m <- mean(samp)

# Assign the standard deviation to object "s"
s <- 8 / sqrt(300)

# Calculate the upper confidence interval
m + ( 1.96 * s )

# Calculate the lower confidence interval
m - ( 1.96 * s )
