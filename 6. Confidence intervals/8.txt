Calculating A Confidence Interval for a Proportion II
In your study you found that a proportion p of 0.35 of your sample said they have road rage. The standard error of this proportion is found through square root of: p multiplied by 1 - p, divided by n. Let's try this!

Instructions
100 XP
Add a line of code that calculates the standard error of p, and stores this as se
Remember to format your calculations correctly and use () where appropriate
If you want to take a look at your dataset, it is still saved in your console as roadrage





# Make p the proportion of the sample with road rage 
p <- 70 / 200
# Find the standard error of p
se <- sqrt( (p * (1 - p)) / 200)
