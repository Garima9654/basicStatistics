Labelling A Bar Graph
Now we're going to add some labels to the bar graph, still using barplot().
 The first argument of barplot() was a vector of the bar heights. Following this, we can add arguments to format the graph as necessary. For instance, barplot(height, argument1, argument2). Here we are going to add a label to the y axis using the argument ylab = "name here", and x axis labels to the bars using the argument names.arg = "vector of names here".

Instructions

Make a vector of the names of the bars using the c() command. Assign this to 
the variable barnames. Remember that the first bar is automatic and the second is manual.
Add the ylab = and names.arg = commands to your barplot(height) code
Label the y axis "number of cars" and use barnames to label the bars.
Remeber that arguments in a function are separated with a comma 
(e.g. function(argument1, argument2, argument3))



# vector of bar heights
height <- table(mtcars$am)
# Make a vector of the names of the bars called "barnames"
barnames <- c("automatic", "manual")
# Label the y axis "number of cars" and label the bars using barnames
barplot(height, ylab = "number of cars", names.arg = barnames)
