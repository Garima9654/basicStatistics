Formatting Your Histogram
Sometimes we have to change things because R's default setting isn't suitable for our graph. In the same way as we added a title argument to hist(), we can change the scale of the y-axis through adding the argument ylim followed by the range we want (e.g. for a scale from 0 to 50, we would say ylim = c(0,50)). We can also label the x-axis using the argument xlab = "title", or change the colour of the bars to blue with the argument col = "blue".

Instructions
100 XP
Change the y axis scale from 0 to 20
Make the bars "red"
Label the x-axis "Number of Carburetors"
Remember that you should separate each argument with a comma




# arguments to change the y-axis scale to 0 - 20, label the x-axis and colour the bars red
hist(mtcars$carb, main = "Carburetors", ylim = c(0,20), xlab = "Number of Carburetors", col = "red")
