QR outliers
In the boxplot you created you can see a circle above the boxplot. This indicates an outlier. We can calculate an outlier as a value 1.5 * IQR above the third quartile, or 1.5 * IQR below the first quartile. Let's try it out with the qsec variable from mtcars.

In your console, find the value of the interquartile range of the qsec variable of mtcars using IQR().
In your console, find the values of the first and third quartiles of the qsec variable of mtcars using quantile()
In your console, calculate the upper threshold value for an outlier. Report this value in your script.
In your console, calculate the lower threshold value for an outlier. Report this value in your script.


# What is the threshold value for an outlier below the first quartile?
13.88125
# What is the threshold value for an outlier above the third quartile?
