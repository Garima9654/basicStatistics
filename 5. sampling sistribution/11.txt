Calculating areas with sample means (2)
In the last exercise, we calculated the area under the curve right of our sample mean of 26. We found that this area had a probability of 0.023. Let's visualize this:



You may notice that this distribution of sample means is much narrower than the distribution of observations of individual hipsters. How would you interpret the red area?
