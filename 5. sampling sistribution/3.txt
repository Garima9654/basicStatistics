Mean of the sampling distribution
The mean of a sample that you take from the population will never be very far away from the population mean (provided that you randomly sample from the population). Furthermore, the mean of the sampling distribution, that is the mean of the mean of all the samples that we took from the population will never be far away from the population mean. Let's observe this in practice.

Calculate the mean of the population and print it. Note that the population is included in the variable scandinavia_data.
Calculate the mean of the sample means and print it. Note that the sample means are included in the variable sample_means.
Note how close the two are






# set the seed such that you will get the same sample as in the solution code
set.seed(11225)

# empty vector sample means
sample_means <- NULL

# take 200 samples from scandinavia_data
for (i in 1:500){
  samp <- sample(scandinavia_data, 200)
  sample_means[i] <- mean(samp)
}

# mean scandinavia data
mean(scandinavia_data)

# mean sample means
mean(sample_means)
