Using a for loop
Not surprisingly, every time we take another random sample, we get a different sample mean. It's useful to get a sense of just how much variability we should expect when estimating the population mean this way.

The distribution of sample means, or the sampling distribution, can help us understand this variability. However, before continuing with the sampling distirubtion, we will firstly introduce the concept of a for loop in R.

Every time some operation has to be repeated a specific number of times, a for loop may come in handy. We only need to specify how many times or upon which conditions those operations need execution: we assign initial values to a control loop variable, perform the loop and then, once finished, we typically do something with the results.

# initialize an empty vector
new_number <- NULL

#'run an operation 10 times.
#'The ith position of new number will be set to i
#'at the end of the loop, the vector new_number is printed
for (i in 1:10){
  new_number[i] <- i
}

print(new_number)
