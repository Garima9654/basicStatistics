Sampling distributions and proportions (2)
So let's continue working with proportions. Imagine we took a random sample of 200 people from London's general population, and a proportion of 0.13 of these people were hipsters. We however know that in the population of London, the proportion of hipsters is 0.10. What is the probability of finding a sample of 200 with a proportion of 0.13 or more hipsters?

Let's break this problem into steps. Firstly we can calculate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. The second step is using a function that may look familiar: pnorm(). Although we do not have a mean, we can use our sampling and population proportions. Our sampling proportion will constitute the q argument here, while our population proportion will constitute the mean argument. Now let's get going, what is the probability of finding a sample of 200 with a proportion of 0.13 or more hipsters?

Calculate the probability of finding a sample of 200 with a proportion of 0.13 or more hipsters using the pnorm() function.






# calculate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
sample_sd <- sqrt((0.10 * (1 - 0.10)) / 200)

# calculate the probability
pnorm(0.13, mean = 0.10, sd = sample_sd, lower.tail = FALSE)
