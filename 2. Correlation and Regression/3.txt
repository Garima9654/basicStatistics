Calculating Percentage From Your Contingency Table
Have a look at the contingency table of tobacco consumption and education you made in the last exercise. It's saved in your console as st. Let's use it to calculate some percentages!

In this exercise you need to report your answers to one decimal place. You are free to do this manually, but if you want a quick way to do this through R you can use the round() function. The first argument of round() is the value that you want to round (this can be in the form of a raw number, or an equation), and the second argument is digits =, where you specify the number of decimal places you want the number rounded to. For instance, round(12.6734, digits = 2) would return the value 12.67.
