Putting It Together: Regression
Let's try to put it all together. You've conducted a study looking at how much money people have (dependent variable) and their education level (independent variable). Let's check some different things in your data!

Instructions
100 XP
Calculate the Pearson r correlation coefficient between your two variables
Calculate your regression coefficients and assign them to a new variable called line
Print the regression coefficients you have assigned
Make a scatterplot of your variables. Label the graph "My Scatterplot" (remember you can do this with the main = argument)
Add the regression line to your scatterplot






# your data
money <- c(4, 3, 2, 2, 8, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 9, 8, 12)
education <- c(3, 4, 6, 9, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 8, 7, 6, 9)

# calculate the correlation between X and Y
cor(money, education)

# save regression coefficients as object "line"
line <- lm(money ~ education)

# print the regression coefficients
line

# plot Y and X
plot(education, money, main = "My Scatterplot")

# add the regression line
abline(line)
