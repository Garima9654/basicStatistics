The Regression Equation
The regression equation is Y = a + bx, where a is the intercept and b is the slope of the line. Imagine we are investigating how extraversion affects risk taking. According to the regression formula, someone with an extraversion level of 0 will have a risk taking level of 3, and with every single unit increase in extraversion, risk taking increases by 3.3.
