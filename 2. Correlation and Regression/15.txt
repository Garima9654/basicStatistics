Using lm() To Add A Regression Line To Your Plot
In the last exercise you used lm() to obtain the coefficients for your model's regression equation, in the format lm(y ~ x). takes the y variabWe can store this output and use it to add the regression line to your scatterplots! After you have created your scatterplot, you can add a line using the function abline(). abline() takes the intercept of the line as its first argument, and the slope of the line as its second argument. This makes it a pretty good candidate for storing your lm() output as an object, and putting it straight into abline. Let's try this out!

Instructions

Use lm() to obtain the regression coefficients for your model. Assign this to an object called line
Use abline() to add a line to your graph based on the output of "line"




# Your plot
plot(money, prosocial, xlab = "Money", ylab = "Prosocial Behavior")
# Store your regression coefficients in a variable called "line"
line <- lm(prosocial ~ money)
# Use "line" to tell abline() to make a line on your graph
abline(line)
