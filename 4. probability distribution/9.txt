The normal distribution and Z scores
A special form of the normal probability distribution is the standard normal distribution, 
also known as the z - distribution. A z distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
Often you can transform variables to z values. You can transform the values of a variable to z-scores by subtracting the mean, and dividing this by the standard deviation. If you perform this transformation on the values of a data set, your transformed data set will ave a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The formula to transform a value to a z score is the following:

 

The Z-score represents how many standard deviations from the mean a value lies.

Imagine we have a woman with a hair length of 38 centimers and the average hair length was 25 centimers and the standard deviation was 5 centimers. Calculate the Z value for this woman and store it in the variable z_value. 
Round z_value to one decimal.



# calculate the z value and store it in the variable z_value
z_value <- (38 - 25) / 5
