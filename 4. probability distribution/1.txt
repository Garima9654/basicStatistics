Probability mass and density functions
From the lectures you may recall the concepts of probability mass and density functions. Probability mass functions relate to
 the probability distributions discrete variables, while probability density functions relate to probability distributions of continuous variables. Suppose we have the following probability density function:

Using the barplot function, make a probability histrogram of 
the above above probability mass function. Specify the height of the bars 
with the y variable and the names of the bars (names.arg), that is, the labels on the x axis, with the x variable in your dataframe.





# the data frame
data <- data.frame(outcome = 0:5, probs = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1))

# make a histogram of the probability distribution
barplot(names = data$outcome, height = data$probs)
