Independence
Enter plants into your console to see information about whether 90 plants live indoors or outdoors, and whether they are a flower, a succulent or a tree. The values in this table represent probabilities.

The probability of one event is independent of another if the probability of the first event occuring is unaffected by whether or not the other event occurs, i.e. if P(A|B) = P (A). Let's see if this is the case with our plants dataset.
