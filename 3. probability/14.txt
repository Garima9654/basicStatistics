Now let's pretend that you have 6 alcohol drinkers and 4 non-alcohol drinkers in a room. Without knowing who is who, you pick three in sequence to take part in your study. Let's consider the probability of various outcomes.


Answer the questions in your script by writing out your calculations in full below
Do not simplify your fractions



# Calculate the probability that the first two people drink alcohol
 6/10 * 5/9
# Calculate the probability that at the first and third person drink alcohol
(6/10 * 5/9 * 4/8) + (6/10 * 4/9 * 5/8)
# Calculate the complement of the the probability that none of the people drink
1 - (4/10 * 3/9 * 2/8)
