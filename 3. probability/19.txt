Conditional Probability II
You may remember from the lectures that the conditional probability of A given B is related to the conditional probability of B given A. To demonstrate this, in your script we have provided the probability that a plant is a tree given that it lives outdoors saved as x, and the probability that a plant lives outdoors given that it is a tree y. According to the formula , you can multiply x by the probability of B, and y by the probability of A to make x and y equivalent. Let's try this!

Instructions
100 XP
Using the plants probability table saved in your console, identify the value of P(A) and P(B) and add these in the correct parts of your script.
Hit submit and look at the values of x and y.



# Probability that a plant is a tree, given that it lives outdoors
x <- 0.275 * (0.22 + 0.07 + 0.11)

# Probability that a plant lives outdoors, given that it is a tree
y <- 0.6875 * (0.05 + 0.11)
  
# Print x and y
c(x, y)
