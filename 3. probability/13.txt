Practise With Sets II
Before approaching the first 3 people in the street to ask whether or not they drink alcohol you assume that the probability of a 'yes' answer is 0.6, and a 'no' answer is 0.4, and you now consider the probability of various outcomes. We will assume independence in this situation because one person (trial) won't influence whether or not another person drinks.

# Calculate the probability that the first two people drink alcohol
0.6 + 0.6
# Calculate the probability that the first and third person you approach drink alcohol
(0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 ) + (0.6 * 0.4 * 0.6 )
# Calculate the complement of the outcome that none of the people drink
1 - (0.4 * 0.4 * 0.4)
